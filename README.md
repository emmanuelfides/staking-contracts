# Classic locked staking
The classic locked staking contract provides a flexible locked staking solution.

- The contract is designed to reward users who lock their tokens for a pre-defined period of time.
- To qualify for the rewards, the user must keep their funds until the lock period is finished.
- As long as users have a non-zero balance, they can top up their deposit without extending the lock time.Â 
- The staked tokens can be withdrawn at any time using the emergency withdrawal function BUT the rewards will be lost.
